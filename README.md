### Summary


**snapwm** is a xinerama and xrandr aware, minimal and lightweight dynamic tiling window manager.

All configuration is read from three files in ~/.config/snapwm/ and is reloadable on the run.

*rc.conf* has colours and window manager configurations.

*key.conf* is mandatory for shortcuts and commands to run.

*apps.conf* is optional and where apps settings are read from.

### Modes

It allows the "normal" method of tiling window managers with the new
    window as the master or with the new window opened at the bottom
    or the top of the stack.

 *There's vertical tiling mode:*

    --------------
    |        | W |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

 *Horizontal tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    | W |   |   |
    -------------

 *Grid tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |      | W  |
    |Master|    |
    |------|----|
    |      |    |
    -------------

 *Stacking mode:*

    -------------
    |   _______  |
    |  |  ___  | |
    |  | |___| | |
    |  |_______| |
    -------------


 *Fullscreen mode*(which you'll know when you see it)

 All accessible with keyboard shortcuts defined in key.conf file.
 
 * The window *W* at the top of the stack can be resized on a per desktop basis.
 * Changing a tiling mode or window size on one desktop doesn't affect the other desktops.
 * Windows can be added/removed to/from the master area with keyboard shortcuts
 * There is a bar with a desktop switcher, space to show the focused window's name and space to show external text.
 * The rc files are reloadable 'on the run'.
